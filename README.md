# chronostasis

Hi, I'm cronomaestro, and this is my personal gemini capsule.

**chronostasis**, n.: a type of temporal illusion in which the first impression following the introduction of a new event or task-demand to the brain can appear to be extended in time. common occurrence of this illusion is known as the stopped-clock illusion, where the second hand of an analog clock appears to stay still for longer than normal when looking at it for the first time.
