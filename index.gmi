## cronomaestro's time capsule

Hi, I'm cronomaestro! You can call me crono for short. 

I love writing journals, play videogames, especially roguelikes, RTS games, and RPGs, and listen to a whole lot of music.
This is my personal gemlog, I'll try to update it once every week with my personal thoughts on everything and nothing at the same time.

This page is under construction as of 2022-02-12. Remember to check it out once in a while!
Huge thanks to @koyuchan for hosting this capsule on her site. You rock, girl!

### Coming soon:

* what I've learned while studying German
* how to keep a daily journal
<<<<<<< HEAD
* random stuff about my life
