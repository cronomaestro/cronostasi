Hi, I'm cronomaestro! You can call me crono for short. Welcome to my personal gemlog, I'll try to update it once a week.
I love writing journals, play videogames, especially roguelikes, RTS games, and RPGs, and listen to a whole lot of music.

This page is under construction as of 2022-02-12. Remember to check it out once in a while!
Huge thanks to @koyuchan for hosting this capsule on her site. You rock, girl!

### Coming soon:

* what I've learned while studying German
* how to keep a daily journal
* random stuff about my life

### Where can you find me:
